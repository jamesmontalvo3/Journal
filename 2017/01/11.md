Today I must leave work by 4pm and get over to Neptune. I need to get 5 solid hours of work in over there. Here's what I'm going to do:

1. Install electrical for dishwasher and disposal
2. Install disposal
3. Install what pipes are possible
4. If daylight: island electrical
5. Install baseboards, caulk
