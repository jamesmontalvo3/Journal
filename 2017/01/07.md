Sleep: 8.25
Sleep notes: Woke up around 6am and didn't really fall back asleep, making 2 hours of that 8.25 not really sleep.

Part of journaling is to sort out my thoughts so I'm acting in the most self-directed method possible, rather than haplessly moving through life. What I need to direct myself to do now is to work efficiently on Neptune. That means:

1. Keep working, don't get distracted
2. Work on things I can't easily pay someone else to do

Also, I shouldn't fear help from Bob.

Okay...back to work.
