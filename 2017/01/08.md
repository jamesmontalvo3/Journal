Sleep: 7.25

## 08:33:09 CST

Neck hurts this morning. Probably need to be sleeping on my back. Took some ibuprofen and going to take a hot shower once it kicks in to try to loosen up.

I waited until the football game yesterday at 3:30 (Texans wildcard victory over Oakland) to eat, so I mostly satisfied my fasting requirement. But the food I ate was terrible. Aside from a bowl of kale soup, I ate a ton of chips and queso and way too many cookies. Not working out makes it very hard for me to stick to good eating. Another reason Neptune needs to be finished soon.

At Neptune yesterday I did some electrical, then puttied the remaining crown molding and painted the ceiling along it to cover up the putty. Today I'll paint the moulding, then finish install of the upper cabinet doors and side pieces.

Need to bring to Neptune:

* Ladder
* Paper to put on the floor when painting
* Bluetooth speaker
