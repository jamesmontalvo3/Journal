Sleep: 8.0

## 06:40:12 CST

This morning, after dropping Astrid off at the bus but before I go to work, I'm going to go to Neptune to sand some door trim, caulk a baseboard, and prime the door trim and a window sill. I'm going to try to do it fast, then get to work quickly. I'm hoping this strategy makes me move quickly on these few items. Also it'll pave the way for me to be complete with the breakfast area this evening. That will allow me to move on to trying to complete the kitchen next.

Neptune is consuming my thoughts. 

## To do

* Ask David about spliting an electrical outlet for dish/disposal
* Figure out how to get long, straight, cheap boards to do tile
